## Introduction
You have probably noticed the election posters that have gone up all over the city as local candidates and political parties ramp up their advertising before the local and regional elections taking place on the **18th of November 2025**. I really encourage all that are eligible (Danes and internationals) to vote!

## Can I vote as an international?
If, as an international person living in Denmark, you are wondering whether you are eligible to vote in these _local and regional_ elections, wonder no more, because the answer is – it depends! But actually, it is clear:
 
**Yes, you can vote if:**
- You are a citizen of another EU Member State or Iceland, Norway or the UK, or
- You have been permanently residing in Denmark for at least 4 years.  

Sources and more info (in English): https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/rights/elections-in-denmark and https://www.elections.im.dk/local-elections.

If you are eligible to vote, you are automatically enrolled on the voting register and you _should_ receive a “poll card” approximately 5 days before Election Day (18 Nov). This will have info on where you should vote. Take this poll card with you to the polling station on Election Day. Take some form of identification just in case (e.g. passport, residence card, driver’s license, other ID) – this is not strictly required, but if there is “doubt about your identity”, then you may be asked to provide proof of your identity.  

If you have not received your poll card, or you have forgotten to bring it to the polling station, you can still vote. Just go to your nearest polling station (e.g. a school) and ask them where you should vote.

_**Democracy can be a fickle thing and can disappear quickly if we do not actively participate and exercise our democratic rights whenever we get the chance. I therefore sincerely hope that everyone who is eligible will decide to vote, either for your own interests and/or on behalf of those internationals who are not eligible to vote themselves, but are living Denmark.**_
 
## On Election Day, at the voting station
- Present yourself at the voting table indicated on your poll card and turn over your poll card to the keeper of the electoral register. You will be requested to give your date of birth and potentially also your name and/or address.
- You will then receive two ballots: one ballot paper for the local election and one ballot paper for the regionalelection.
- You vote by putting **ONE** cross “X” on each of these ballot papers, **either** next to the party you want to vote for **OR** next to the candidate you want to vote for - **not both!** If you have more than one cross on a ballot paper, your ballot paper will be _invalid_ and your vote will _not be counted_.
- You can also vote blank – i.e. put the unmarked ballot paper(s) in the ballot box.

:warning: The ballot lists are **very long** (multiple pages), as there are many candidates running for each political party! Prepare yourself mentally and try not to get overwhelmed. Remember which party or candidate you decided to vote for and _calmly_ put a cross next to their name. Good luck and enjoy! 

## What if I am not able to vote on Election Day?
**If you are not able to vote on 18 November (e.g. you are travelling outside the country), _you can still vote_ via "Advance Voting".** Advance voting is already open and closes on 14 Nov.
- Advance Voting usually takes place at local libraries and/or community centers.
- See the following website for general information about “Advance Voting”: https://www.elections.im.dk/advance-voting.
- Check your local municipality website for Advance Voting locations.
- Here is a list of locations where you can cast your advanced vote in Copenhagen (in Danish – use Google Translate if needed): [https://www.kk.dk/politik/valg/kommunal-og-regionsraadsvalg-2025/brevstemmesteder](https://www.kk.dk/politik/valg/kommunal-og-regionsraadsvalg-2025/brevstemmesteder)
- Note: The Danish term for Advance Voting, "brevstemme" (translated as “vote by mail” or “postal voting”) is a misnomer, as you actually vote in person, but just ahead of time.

## Guide to political parties in Denmark
Now that you know whether you are eligible to vote or not, you might be wondering which party or candidate you would even vote for?! This is of course a personal choice and up to you to decide, but to help you make that decision as an international, see the following guide (in English) to Denmark’s political parties: https://lwid.dk/denmarks-political-parties-your-essential-guide/

## General resources for internationals in Denmark
